## Program for personal use
A program to randomly select 'm' saving throws and 'n' skill checks from the available skill checks and saving throws from Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition

I created this program to help diversify the skills and saving throws I use in my dungeons and dragons sessions as the DM.

I felt that my sessions were using a lot of the same skill checks such as persuasion or perception, while simultaneously other skills were hardly ever used such as sleight of hand or performance.
To help with this I created this program to randomly select skills and saving throws for me to try to work into my sessions

For instance, soon the party will be speaking with someone of high status, requiring them to do a performance check to see how well they can follow the high standards for manners while talking to someone of high status is an idea I thought of while trying to use the skills that I haven't been using as much
